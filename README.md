<h3> Correlation Analysis on MLB Data </h3> 

This is a little project I did exploring a sample data set I obtained from the 2014 MLB season. Using 10 teams comprising
the AL East and NL East divisions, I wanted to find out if a team's batting average (the response variable) is connected in any way on the 
number of home runs hit by the team (the predictor variable). For the R code used in the analysis of this data set, feel free to visit the <a href="        "> code file </a> .
